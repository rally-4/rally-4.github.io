            <p>
                Let's say we were on a search for a solution, a solution to all problems which arose from the materialist greed of most big shots. <br>
                That is to say, no more privacy concerns, no more governmental corruption, no more ideological conflicts, etc. <br>
                <br>
                One of the most hopeful solutions would be creating an AI which could, ideally, solve these problems for us altogether. <br>
                The question is the following: what makes us think it would be any better than us? Even with the necessary technology,
                being "smarter" won't mean it's better. Humanity is smarter than all other species, yet that intellect has led to
                atrocious things. When progress is made, it's always been both for the better and for the worse. <br>
                There are many more arguments against this, such as the impossibility that such AI could ever be made. <br>
                <br>
                Another way to go about this would be to have a revolution, however, even if we let aside the fact that the solution
                wouldn't be generally applicable, it's very apparent those in power have an inmense control over the general population,
                and thus such thing could never happen. <br>
                <br>
                Trying to get them to comprehend the situation(s) and put an end to their materialist and self-preservative purposes is
                also not possible, as they are typically isolated from the public's opinions and often times even believe their own lies. <br>
                <br>
                These and many other hopeful ways to solve the problems which will, undoubtedly, lead to a dystopian future for us, won't work. <br>
                As such, I present to you: Rally4's Triple Negative. <br>
                <br>
                The solution can't be found. <br>
                The solution can't be portable. <br>
                The solution can't have a practical implementation and can't be generally applicable. <br>
                <br>
